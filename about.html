            <center>The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to as the Gita, is a revered ancient scripture that holds profound wisdom and timeless teachings. Comprising 700 verses, it is a dialogue between Lord Krishna and Prince Arjuna, set against the backdrop of the Kurukshetra War in the Indian epic Mahabharata.
