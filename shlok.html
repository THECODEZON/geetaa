    Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna. Perform your duty and abandon all attachments to success or failure. Such evenness of mind is called yoga.
    
    <summary><small>Lessons:
        In this shloka, Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his duties with an evenness of mind, without getting attached to the outcome. He emphasizes the importance of detachment and encourages Arjuna to focus on the present moment and the task at hand, rather than worrying about the future or regretting the past. 
        
        By doing so, one can achieve a state of balance and equanimity, which is the ultimate goal of yoga. This shloka from Bhagavad Gita teaches us the importance of being focused and present in our actions, and not getting bogged down by the fear of failure or the desire for success.</div></small></summary>

        <h1><b>Important Bhagavad Gita Slokas for Self-Realization</b></h1>

        <h1>4. Shloka 4.38 (Chapter 4, Verse 38)

            In Sanskrit:</h1>
      <div class="card">
        न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते।

तत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति॥

na hi jñānena sadṛśaṃ pavitramiha vidyate

tatsvayaṃ yogasaṃsiddhaḥ kālenātmani vindati
        </div>

        <div><b>Translation (Meaning in English): </b>
           <summary><small>In this world, there is nothing so purifying as knowledge. One who has attained perfection in yoga, finds it within himself in due course of time.

            Lessons:
            As one of the best slokas from Bhagavad Gita, it teaches us that knowledge is the most powerful tool for purifying oneself. It is through knowledge that one can overcome ignorance and attain enlightenment.
            
            Yoga is a means to attain knowledge and self-realization. Through the practice of yoga, one can achieve a state of union with the divine and discover the true nature of the self.
            
            It also tells us that the path to self-realization is not easy and requires time, effort, and dedication. 
            
            It is a gradual process that requires patience and perseverance. Moreover, self-realization is not something that can be attained through external means. It is a journey of self-discovery that takes place within oneself.

        <h1>5. Shloka 2.21 (Chapter 2, Verse 21)

            In Sanskrit:</h1>
      <div class="card">
        वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यं य एनमजमव्ययम्‌ ।

        कथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम्‌ ॥
        
        vedāvināśinaṃ nityaṃ ya enamajamavyayam
        
        kathaṃ sa puruṣaḥ pārtha kaṃ ghātayati hanti kam
        </div>

        <div><b>Translation (Meaning in English): </b>
           <summary><small>O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, unborn, eternal and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?

            Lessons:
            The lesson from this Bhagavad Gita verse is that the true self, the soul, is eternal and indestructible. It cannot be killed, nor can it kill. It is the body that is mortal and subject to birth and death. 
            
            Therefore, we should not be attached to the physical body and should not cause harm to others or ourselves. This shloka teaches us to recognize the true nature of ourselves and others, and to act with compassion and wisdom.
